# Startink-Tkinter

Today in class we worked with a new module called tkinter. It is a library that allows you to make a gui in python. The other thing we learned was something
called lambda which is a nameless function. We used these in the programs I created today which was cool and it was a good refresher.
The first thing that I created with it was a program that is able to do simple math programs, such as adding, subtracting, i also hope to add 
multiplying, squaring, dividing, etc. Then I moved on to experiement with drawing program called Tate. It allowed me to get an overview for 
the project that we are making later. Below are the pictures of the two things that I created.
